You might also want to append the $BRANCH name to the end of git command, so that to make sure it checks out the expected branch. 
I had waste some time on this, because I had set my default branch to "master" while I'd like to deploy with another branch called "deploy".

#!/bin/bash
TRAGET="/home/webuser/deploy-folder"
GIT_DIR="/home/webuser/www.git"
BRANCH="master"

while read oldrev newrev ref
do
	# only checking out the master (or whatever branch you would like to deploy)
	if [[ $ref = refs/heads/$BRANCH ]];
	then
		echo "Ref $ref received. Deploying ${BRANCH} branch to production..."
		git --work-tree=$TRAGET --git-dir=$GIT_DIR checkout -f $BRANCH
	else
		echo "Ref $ref received. Doing nothing: only the ${BRANCH} branch may be deployed on this server."
	fi
done
