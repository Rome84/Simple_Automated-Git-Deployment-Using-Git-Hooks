Hi, If you're here looking for make deployment to same server but different branch, this worked for me

#!/bin/bash
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    # only checking out the master (or whatever branch you would like to deploy)
    if [[ $ref = refs/heads/master ]];
    then
        echo "Master ref received.  Deploying master branch to production..."
        git --work-tree=/home/webuser/public --git-dir=/home/webuser/www.git checkout -f master
    else
        if [[ $ref = refs/heads/sandbox ]];
        then
                echo "Sandbox ref received. Deploying sandbox branch to beta..."
                git --work-tree=/home/webuser/beta --git-dir=/home/webuser/www.git checkout -f sandbox
        else
                echo "Ref $ref successfully received.  Doing nothing: only the master branch may be deployed on this server."
        fi
    fi
done
